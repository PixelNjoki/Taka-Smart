## 🧱 Problem Statement

Urban centers across Kenya face growing challenges related to solid waste management. Rapid urbanization has increased waste generation, but collection and disposal systems have not kept pace. Many neighborhoods experience irregular garbage collection, illegal dumping, and blocked drainage systems. These challenges lead to environmental degradation, flooding, and outbreaks of diseases such as cholera and malaria.

Existing systems rely heavily on manual reporting — phone calls, physical visits, or complaints through social media — which are inefficient and lack proper tracking. Residents have no structured platform to report issues and monitor progress. 

Local youth groups and environmental organizations often organize clean-ups, but they face coordination difficulties due to lack of data on problem areas. There is an urgent need for a simple, accessible, and community-driven digital solution that allows real-time reporting and enhances collaboration between citizens and authorities.

**TakaSmart** addresses this gap by providing a centralized web platform for waste issue reporting and tracking in Kenyan communities.
